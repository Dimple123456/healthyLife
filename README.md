I created a HealthyLife website using Bootstrap, focusing on an attractive, modern, and fully responsive design. The site includes a wide range of Bootstrap components such as navigation bars, cards, carousels, forms, and modals to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience. The project highlights my ability to build visually appealing layouts quickly with Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and pre-built UI elements, while maintaining responsiveness across devices.
